# Socket Programming in Java: Chat Application

## Overview
This project is a **client-server chat application** built using **Java Socket Programming**. It is designed to provide hands-on experience in network programming, focusing on **TCP sockets**, **multithreading**, and **real-time communication**.

## Objectives
- Practice **Socket Programming** in Java.
- Build a **simple chat application** using a **client-server model**.
- Implement a **multithreaded server** to handle multiple clients simultaneously.

## Features
- **Client-Server Architecture**: The server manages multiple clients using **multithreading**.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Clients can exchange messages through the server.
- **Multiple Client Support**: Several users can connect and chat at the same time.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: Uses Java's built-in **`Socket`** and **`ServerSocket`** classes.
